# Traffic spreading

This repository contains simulation data obtained from a calibrated and validated dynamic traffic assignment model of Melbourne, known as DynaMel, needed to reproduce the results in a working paper titled "A simple contagion process describes spreading of traffic jams in urban networks" authored by Saberi et al.

Data includes road network information from Melbourne, Australia and simulated link speeds and volumes for the morning peak period 6-10 AM for various scenarios with different travel demand level.

Data is in tabular format and includes multiple columns as below:

Column 1: Link ID Column 2: Link length (meter) Column 3: Speed limit Column 4-7: Coordinates of the start and end of each link Column 8-39: Link volumes for different simulation time intervals starting from 6:00 AM and increasing in 15-minute intervals Column 40-71: Link speeds for different simulation time intervals starting from 6:00 AM and increasing in 15-minute intervals

Different simulated demand levels include 100%, 120%, 150%, 175%, and 200%.
